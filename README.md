# android-SimpleTodo

This is my first Android demo application for creating a basic Todo list by following CodePath's [walkthrough] (https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/15JnmfmFa0hJOEkBhG_TeymChLzDzpOTJvBlOj29A9fY/edit#slide=id.gf45d6347_3_155)

#####Time spent: 2 hours spent in total

#####Completed user stories:

* Required: User can view a list of existing items when launching the app.

* Required: User can add a new item by inputing text in the text field.

* Required: User can remove an item by long clicking the target item.

* Required: User can tap an item in the list and bring up an edit screen. Any change to the text will be reflected in the list.

######Notes:

Alought this is a simple application, it demostrates many essential concepts:

* Using **RelativeLayout** to constructing View Layouts.
* Using **ArrayAdapter** to convert an ArrayList of objects into View items loaded into the ListView container.
* Using an **Intent** to link two screens (activities) within your application.

#####Walkthrough of all user stories:
